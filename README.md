### Thanks for stopping by! I'm Sylvia ðŸ‘‹

I have tremedous respect and appreciation for all of the incredible work and passion that goes into the creation of clever, user-friendly technology that simplifies and elevates our day-to-day lives. I am inspired by the endless possibilities that backend development has shown me,  and I look forward to an opportunity to contribute to a team of talented, innovative, passionate people where I can add value, learn, grow and collaborate to build something great together! 

Some technologies that I enjoy working with are:<br />
 :white_check_mark: Java<br />
 :white_check_mark: AWS API Gateway<br />
 :white_check_mark: AWS DynamoDB<br />
 :white_check_mark: AWS Lambda<br />

 
I am a believer of continuous self-growth and development and am technologically curious by nature :monocle_face: I love learning new things, and so I am currently expanding my programming language skillset to include Python ðŸŒ± I am resourceful and determined, so if the answer is not right there in front of me I am keen to adventure and discover!

**My goal is to join a force that embraces challenges, thrives on teamwork, cultivates continuous growth, and has an outstanding reputation for customer service.** 

I want to be a part of the team that causes customers to say things like: 
"What will they come up with next:interrobang:",  "How did they do that:interrobang:", "Thank goodness for this app, without it I wouldn't be so produtive :raised_hands:", "This app makes my life so much easier :relaxed:" 

I look forward to contributing to the development and production of technology designed to simplify and enrich life.

## Together, we can do amazing things :star_struck:
